# Cloud Network  


This outlines my first project, which is a collection of Linux Scripts and Ansible Scripts from my Cyber Security Bootcamp. Many of the scripts were used to configure cloud servers with docker containers. 

The final step will show (4) servers that were running vulnerable DVWA containers along with a jump box and a server running on ELK Stack.
